%% Modeling Target Radar Cross Section 
% This example shows how to model radar targets with increasing levels of
% fidelity. The example introduces the concept of radar cross sections
% (RCS) for simple point targets and extends it to more complicated cases
% of targets with multiple scattering centers. It also discusses how to
% model fluctuations of the RCS over time and briefly considers the case of
% polarized signals.

%% Introduction
% A radar system relies on target reflection or scattering to detect and
% identify targets. The more strongly a target reflects, the greater the
% returned echo at the radar receiver, resulting in a higher
% signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and likelier detection. In radar systems, the
% amount of energy reflected from a target is determined by the radar cross
% section (RCS), defined as
%
% $$\sigma = \lim_{R->\infty}4\pi R^2 \frac{|E_s|^2}{|E_i|^2}$$
%
% where $\sigma$ represents the RCS, $R$ is the distance between the radar
% and the target, $E_s$ is the field strength of the signal reflected from
% the target, and $E_i$ is the field strength of the signal incident on the
% target. In general, targets scatter energy in all directions and the RCS
% is a function of the incident angle, the scattering angle, and the signal
% frequency. RCS depends on the shape of the target and the materials from
% which it is constructed. Common units used for RCS include square meters
% or dBsm.
%
% This example focuses on narrowband monostatic radar systems, when the
% transmitter and receiver are co-located. The incident and scattered
% angles are equal and the RCS is a function only of the incident angle.
% This is the _backscattered_ case. For a narrowband radar, the signal
% bandwidth is small compared to the operating frequency and is therefore
% considered to be constant.
%
%% RCS of a Simple Point Target
% The simplest target model is an isotropic scatterer. An example of an
% isotropic scatterer is a metallic sphere of uniform density. In this
% case, the reflected energy is independent of the incident angle. An
% isotropic scatterer can often serve as a first order approximation of a
% more complex point target that is distant from the radar. For example, a
% pedestrian can be approximated by an isotropic scatterer with a 1 square
% meter RCS.

close all;
clear;
clc;

c = 3e8;
fc = 3e8;
pedestrian = phased.RadarTarget('MeanRCS',1,'PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'OperatingFrequency',fc)

%%
% where |c| is the propagation speed and |fc| is the operating frequency of
% the radar system. The scattered signal from a unit input signal can then
% be computed as
x = 1;
ped_echo = pedestrian(x)

%%
% where |x| is the incident signal. The relation between the incident and
% the reflected signal can be expressed as $y = \sqrt{G}*x$ where
%
% $$ G = \frac{4\pi\sigma}{\lambda^2} $$
%
% $G$ represents the dimensionless gain that results from the target
% reflection. $\lambda$ is the wavelength corresponding to the system's
% operating frequency.

%% RCS of Complex Targets
% For targets with more complex shapes, reflections can non longer be
% considered the same across all directions. The RCS varies with the
% incident angles (also known as aspect angles). Aspect-dependent RCS
% patterns can be measured or modeled just as you would antenna radiation
% patterns. The result of such measurements or models is a table of RCS
% values as a function of azimuth and elevation angles in the target's
% local coordinate system.
%
% The example below first computes the RCS pattern of a cylindrical target,
% with a radius of 1 meter and a height of 10 meters, as a function of
% azimuth and elevation angles.
% 
% <<../TargetRCSExample_cylinder.png>>
%

[cylrcs,az,el] = rcscylinder(1,1,10,c,fc);

%%
% Because the cylinder is symmetric around the z axis, there is no
% azimuth-angle dependency. RCS values vary only with elevation angle.

plot(el,pow2db(cylrcs));
grid; axis tight; ylim([-30 30]);
xlabel('Elevation Angles (degrees)');
ylabel('RCS (dBsm)');
title('RCS Pattern for Cylinder');


%%
% The aspect-dependent RCS patterns can then imported into a
% |phased.BackscatterRadarTarget| object.

cylindricalTarget = phased.BackscatterRadarTarget('PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'OperatingFrequency',fc,'AzimuthAngles',az,'ElevationAngles',el,...
    'RCSPattern',cylrcs)
%%
% Finally, generate the target reflection. Assume three equal signals are
% reflected from the target at three different aspect angles.  The first
% two angles have the same elevation angle but with different azimuth
% angles. The last has a different elevation angle from the first two.
x = [1 1 1];            % 3 unit signals 
ang = [0 30 30;0 0 30]; % 3 directions
cyl_echo = cylindricalTarget(x,ang)

%%
% One can verify that there is no azimuth angle dependence because the
% first two outputs are the same.
%
% The number of target shapes for which analytically-derived RCS patterns
% exist are few. For more complicated shapes and materials, computational
% electromagnetics approaches, such as method of moments (MoM), or finite
% element analysis (FEM), can be used to accurately predict the RCS
% pattern. A more detailed discussion of these techniques is available in
% [1]. You can use the output of these computations as input to the
% |phased.BackscatterRadarTarget| System object(TM) as was done in the
% cylinder example before.

%% RCS of Extended Targets with Multiple Scatterers
% Although computational electromagnetic approaches can provide accurate
% RCS predictions, they often require a significant amount of computation
% and are not suitable for real-time simulations. An alternative approach
% for describing a complex targets is to model it as a collection of simple
% scatterers. The RCS pattern of the complex target can then be derived
% from the RCS patterns of the simple scatterer as [1]
%
% $$ \sigma = |\sum_p \sqrt{\sigma_p}e^{i\phi_p}|^2 $$
%
% where $\sigma$ is the RCS of the target, $\sigma_p$ is the RCS of the $p$
% th scatterer, and $\phi_p$ is the relative phase of the $p$ th scatterer.
% A multi-scatterer target behaves much like an antenna array.
%
% The next section shows how to model a target consisting of four
% scatterers. The scatterers are located at the four vertices of a square.
% Each scatterer is a cylindrical point target as derived in the previous
% section. Without loss of generality, the square is placed in the _xy_
% -plane. The side length of the square is 0.5 meter.
%
% <<../TargetRCSExample_fourscatters.png>>
%
% First, define the positions of the scatterers.

scatpos = [-0.5 -0.5 0.5 0.5;0.5 -0.5 0.5 -0.5;0 0 0 0];

%%
% If the target is in the far field of the transmitter, the incident angle
% for each component scatterer is the same. Then, the total RCS pattern
% can be computed as
naz = numel(az);
nel = numel(el);
extrcs = zeros(nel,naz);
for m = 1:nel
    sv = steervec(scatpos,[az;el(m)*ones(1,naz)]);
    % sv is squared due to round trip in a monostatic scenario
    extrcs(m,:) = abs(sqrt(cylrcs(m,:)).*sum(sv.^2)).^2;
end

%%
% The total RCS pattern then looks like

figure()
helperTargetRCSPatternPlot(az,el,extrcs);
title('RCS Pattern of Extended Target with 4 Scatterers');

%%
% This pattern can then be used in a |phased.BackscatterRadarTarget| object
% to compute the reflected signal. The results verify that the reflected
% signal depends on both azimuth and elevation angles.

extendedTarget = phased.BackscatterRadarTarget('PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'OperatingFrequency',fc,'AzimuthAngles',az,'ElevationAngles',el,...
    'RCSPattern',extrcs);

ext_echo = extendedTarget(x,ang)

%% Wideband RCS of Extended Targets with Multiple Scatterers
% Wideband radar systems are typically defined as having a bandwidth
% greater than 5% of their center frequency. In addition to improved range
% resolution, wideband systems also offer improved target detection. One
% way in which wideband systems improve detection performance is by filling
% in fades in a target's RCS pattern. This can be demonstrated by
% revisiting the extended target comprised of 4 cylindrical scatterers used
% in the preceding section. The modeled narrowband RCS swept across various
% target aspects is shown as

sweepaz = -90:90; % Azimuthal sweep across target
sweepel = 0;
[elg,azg] = meshgrid(sweepel,sweepaz);
sweepang = [azg(:)';elg(:)'];
x = ones(1,size(sweepang,2)); % unit signals

release(extendedTarget);
extNarrowbandSweep = extendedTarget(x,sweepang);

% clf; % We don't need it, as every figure appears in different window
figure()
plot(sweepaz,pow2db(extNarrowbandSweep));
grid on; axis tight;
xlabel('Azimuth Angles (degrees)');
ylabel('RCS (dBsm)');
title(['RCS Pattern at 0^o Elevation ',...
    'for Extended Target with 4 Scatterers']);

%%
% Returns from the multiple cylinders in the extended target model
% coherently combine, creating deep fades between 40 and 50 degrees. These
% fades can cause the target to not be detected by the radar sensor.
% 
% Next, the RCS pattern for a wideband system operating at the same center
% frequency will be examined. The bandwidth for this system will be set to
% 10% of the center frequency

bw = 0.10*fc; % Bandwidth is greater-than 5% of center frequency
fs = 2*bw;

%%
% A wideband RCS model is created as was previously done for the narrowband
% extended target. Often, RCS models are generated offline using either
% simulation tools or range measurements and are then provided to radar
% engineers for use in their system models. Here, it is assumed that the
% provided RCS model has been sampled at 1MHz intervals on either side of
% the radar's center frequency.

modelFreq = (-80e6:1e6:80e6)+fc;
[modelCylRCS,modelAz,modelEl] = helperCylinderRCSPattern(c,modelFreq);

%%
% The contributions from the various scattering centers are modeled as
% before. It is important to note that this approximation assumes that all
% of the target's scattering centers fall within the same range resolution
% bin, which is true for this example.

nf = numel(modelFreq);
naz = numel(modelAz);
nel = numel(modelEl);
modelExtRCS = zeros(nel,naz,nf);
for k = 1:nf
    for m = 1:nel
        pos = scatpos*modelFreq(k)/fc;
        sv = steervec(pos,[modelAz;modelEl(m)*ones(1,naz)]);
        % sv is squared due to round trip in a monostatic scenario
        modelExtRCS(m,:,k) = abs(sqrt(modelCylRCS(m,:,k)).*sum(sv.^2)).^2;
    end
end

%%
% The wideband RCS target model is now generated, using the RCS patterns
% that were just computed.

widebandExtendedTarget = phased.WidebandBackscatterRadarTarget(...
    'PropagationSpeed',c,'OperatingFrequency',fc,'SampleRate',fs,...
    'AzimuthAngles',modelAz,'ElevationAngles',modelEl,...
    'FrequencyVector',modelFreq,'RCSPattern',modelExtRCS);

%%
% The modeled wideband RCS can now be compared to the narrowband system

extWidebandSweep = widebandExtendedTarget(x,sweepang);

% No figure needed, as we need to plot in the same figure
hold on;
plot(sweepaz,pow2db(extWidebandSweep));
hold off;
legend('Narrowband','Wideband');

%%
% The target's RCS pattern now has much shallower nulls between 40 and 50
% degrees azimuth. The deep nulls in the narrowband pattern occur when
% signals combine destructively at a specific frequency and azimuth
% combination. The wideband waveform fills in these fades because, while a
% few frequencies may experience nulls for a given aspect, the majority of
% the bandwidth does not lie within the null at that azimuth angle.

%% RCS of Fluctuating Targets
% The discussion so far assumes that the target RCS value is constant over
% time. This is the nonfluctuating target case. In reality, because both
% the radar system and the target are moving, the RCS value changes over
% time. This case is a fluctuating target. To simulate fluctuating targets,
% Peter Swerling developed four statistical models, referred to as Swerling
% 1 through Swerling 4, that are widely adopted in practice. The Swerling
% models divide fluctuating targets into two probability distributions and
% two time varying behaviors as shown in the following table:
%
%                            Slow Fluctuating      Fast Fluctuating
% -----------------------------------------------------------------
%              Exponential      Swerling 1            Swerling 2
%    4th Degree Chi-square      Swerling 3            Swerling 4
%
% The RCS of a slow-fluctuating target remains constant during a dwell but
% varies from scan to scan. In contrast, the RCS for a fast fluctuating
% target changes with each pulse within a dwell.
%
% The Swerling 1 and 2 models obey an exponential density function (pdf)
% given by
%
% $$ p(\sigma) = \frac{1}{\mu_\sigma}e^{-sigma/\mu_\sigma} $$,
% 
% These models are useful in simulating a target consisting of a collection
% of equal strength scatterers.
%
% The Swerling 3 and 4 models obey a 4th degree Chi-square pdf, given by
%
% $$ p(\sigma) = \frac{4\sigma}{\mu_\sigma^2}e^{-2\sigma/\mu_\sigma} $$,
% 
% These models apply when the target contains a dominant scattering
% component. In both pdf definitions, $\mu_\sigma$ represents the mean
% RCS value, which is the RCS value of the same target under
% the nonfluctuating assumption.
%
% The next section shows how to apply a Swerling 1 statistical model when
% generating the radar echo from the previously described cylindrical
% target.

cylindricalTargetSwerling1 = ...
    phased.BackscatterRadarTarget('PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'OperatingFrequency',fc,'AzimuthAngles',az,'ElevationAngles',el,...
    'RCSPattern',cylrcs,'Model','Swerling1')

%%
% In the Swerling 1 case, the reflection is no longer constant. The RCS
% value varies from scan to scan. Assuming that the target is illuminated
% by the signal only once per dwell, the following code simulates the
% reflected signal power for 10,000 scans for a unit incident signal.

N = 10000;
tgt_echo = zeros(1,N);
x = 1;
for m = 1:N
    tgt_echo(m) = cylindricalTargetSwerling1(x,[0;0],true);
end
p_echo = tgt_echo.^2; % Reflected power

%%
% Plot the histogram of returns from all scans and verify that the
% distribution of the returns match the theoretical prediction. The
% theoretical prediction uses the nonfluctuating RCS derived before. For
% the cylindrical target, the reflected signal power at normal incidence
% for unit power input signal is
p_n = cyl_echo(1)^2;

figure()
helperTargetRCSReturnHistogramPlot(p_echo,p_n)

%% RCS of Polarized Targets
% The target RCS is also a function of polarization. To describe the
% polarization signature of a target, a single RCS value is no longer
% sufficient. Instead, for each frequency and incident angle, a scattering
% matrix is used to describe the interaction of the target with the
% incoming signal's polarization components. This example will not go into
% further details because this topic is covered in the
% <docid:phased_ug#example-ex87963283 Modeling and Analyzing Polarization> example.

%% Conclusion
% This example gave a brief introduction to radar target modeling for
% a radar system simulation. It showed how to model point targets, targets
% with measured patterns, and extended targets. It also described how to
% take statistical fluctuations into account when generating target echoes.
